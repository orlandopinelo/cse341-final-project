Here are a few things to help you get started with the project to work on your local machine:
1. Create your own .env file to hold information in.
2. Type "npm install" into the terminal to obtain all the packages in the node project.
3. Create your collection in your mongodb to match the one sent into teams.

Information for team from team members (Just in case you need to let us know of packages you may have added):

11/27/2024: Created the project and added db connection. If you are having problems connecting try adding "/final" to the end
of your URI in your .env file. Also added the ability to allow you to type "npm start" in the terminal for the project to run.
So far everything works, the db connects, and you are able to make it to the index route. Let me know if you have any questions!
